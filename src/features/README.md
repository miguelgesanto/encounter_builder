interface EncounterChain {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  encounters: string[]; // Encounter IDs
  currentIndex: number;
  storyNotes: string;
  autoProgress: boolean;
}
```

- Creature data import from external sources
- Encounter sharing between users
- Backup and restore functionality

#### 5. Custom Creature Management
**Status**: ❌ Not Started

**Features Needed**:
- Custom creature creation interface
- Homebrew creature database
- Creature template system
- Community creature sharing

### Low Priority

#### 6. Advanced Combat Features
**Status**: ❌ Not Started

**Features Needed**:

## 🔧 Development Guidelines

### Feature Development
1. **Self-Contained**: Each feature should be independently functional
2. **Store Integration**: Use Zustand actions for all state changes
3. **Type Safety**: Comprehensive TypeScript coverage
4. **Mobile-First**: Design for touch interfaces first
5. **Accessibility**: Full keyboard navigation and screen reader support

### Component Architecture
```typescript
// Feature component structure
interface FeatureProps {
  // Minimal props - use store for data
}

export const FeatureComponent: React.FC<FeatureProps> = () => {
  // Zustand store hooks
  const { state, actions } = useEncounterStore();
  
  // Local component state (UI only)
  const [localState, setLocalState] = useState();
  
  // Event handlers
  const handleAction = () => {
    actions.updateState();
  };
  
  return (
    // JSX with proper accessibility
  );
};
```

### Performance Guidelines
1. **Selective Subscriptions**: Only subscribe to needed store slices
2. **Memoization**: Use React.memo for expensive renders
3. **Lazy Loading**: Code split large features
4. **Efficient Updates**: Batch store updates where possible

### Testing Considerations
- Test feature functionality in isolation
- Mock store dependencies for unit tests
- Test responsive behavior on multiple screen sizes
- Verify keyboard and screen reader accessibility

## 🚀 Adding New Features

### 1. Create Feature Directory
```bash
mkdir src/features/new-feature
```

### 2. Implement Core Component
```typescript
// src/features/new-feature/NewFeature.tsx
import React from 'react';
import { useEncounterStore } from '../../stores/encounterStore';

export const NewFeature: React.FC = () => {
  // Implementation
};

export default NewFeature;
```

### 3. Create Feature Index
```typescript
// src/features/new-feature/index.ts
export { default as NewFeature } from './NewFeature';
export { default } from './NewFeature';
```

### 4. Update Store (if needed)
Add new actions and state to the Zustand store for feature data.

### 5. Integrate with App
Import and use the feature in the main application component.
